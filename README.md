# twitch_app
The Twitch application will focus on React.js and Redux and will run a streaming software, a Real Time Messaging Protocol Server that 
broadcasts video streams at the same time, and will use a video feed.  The purpose is to share user streams and will utilize a seperate API for each stream.
